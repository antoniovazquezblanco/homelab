# Dell PERC H200

This is a very common controller among 11th generation Dell servers. Expect good integration with Rx10 and Tx10 models. It will not be as tightly integrated in newer generations.

This controller comes in three variants.

## Modes

The card can operate in either in IR or IT modes.

By default, the card seems to ship an IR mode firmware and internet is full of tutorials on how to flash IT mode firmwares but before you start flashing, I would recommend you have a look at the following reddit thread:

## Frimware flashing

In case you decide to flash IT mode firmware:

In case you realize you want to go back to the stock firmware:
